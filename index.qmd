## Notes on coding style

1. R has different coding paradigms, most importantly base R, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/). In this course we use base R, but give some tips to resources for the tidyverse here and there. 
2. The typical assignment notation in R is `<-`. However, in these materials you will see `=` used for assignment. Both are completely fine to use and these materials use `=` just for preference.

```{r}
#| include: false
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c('knitr', 'quarto'), 'packages-index.bib')
```
