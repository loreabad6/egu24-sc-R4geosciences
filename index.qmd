## Notes on coding style

1. R has different coding paradigms, most importantly base R, [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/). In this course we use base R, but give some tips to resources for the tidyverse here and there.

2. The typical assignment notation in R is `<-`. However, in these materials you will see `=` used for assignment. Both are completely fine to use and these materials use `=` just for preference.

3. Piping: if you are familiar with the tidyverse, you might have seen the use of the `%>%` operator to concatenate functions. Since R 4.1.0 R introduced a native pipe operator `|>` and that is what we use in this workshop. If you are curious about how the native pipe works and differences with the `magrittr` pipe, see [here](https://ivelasq.rbind.io/blog/understanding-the-r-pipe/) and [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/).
